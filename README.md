# BOTS 🤖 run on Steam 🚂⚙️

### This is the layout for most of my steam bots I use. Some bots have different functionalities but the concepts are the same but with different modules used.
### You can use a Steam BOT 🤖 to talk to, automate trading, or just for storage of items, by giving commands via the steam chat. You can give as many options as you want and even display a commands list on request!
### These BOTS 🤖 are very modifiable 🔧 and there are many great tried and tested modules to choose from that add awesome functionality

#### Once your BOT is ready you can host it using this [method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl2Od4mR9Ds) so that he/she's never offline!

###### Please don't use BOTS to scalp the steam market. Valve have measures to prevent this and your BOT will be banned from trading and using the market forever 😥
